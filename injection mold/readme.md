This contains all of the design files for the injection molded face shields.


We want to help as many people produce face shields as possible so we’re making all of our files open source and available to everyone.

We started with the Prusa RC2 design and modified it to be injection molding friendly. With the help of Caro-Polymers, we designed a new bottom support that would accommodate PETG sheets of various thicknesses instead of being limited to only 0.02″ thick PETG.

Our design has been validated by doctors and other Health Care Workers in Charlotte, NC using the following materials to manufacture the face shields:

Following materials are used in this design: </br>
Injection molding: FDA approved Polypropylene </br>
PETG sheet: 0.02″ thick PETG (Our feedback from HCWs recommended 0.02″ thick)
