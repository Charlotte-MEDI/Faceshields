# Working Fusion Models:  
-Live Link Prusa Bottom Reinforcement https://a360.co/2UbwLO5  
-Believe this one should be a spot on replica, easy to alter the underlying sketches and file if needed  
-Live Link Prusa RC2  https://a360.co/3beMKk8  
-More straight lines in this model, much easier to sketch. Haven't test any prints, but model seems to be correct.
