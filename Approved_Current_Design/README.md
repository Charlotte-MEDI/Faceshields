### Printer Settings

We want to ensure the printed part is both strong and flexible, our testing shows best results when the part is printed with **100% infill**.  

*Doesn't 100% infill take longer?*  Yes.  Faster, Better, Cheaper... When it comes to protecting our precious medical resources, the medical professionals, our first priority is the best protection.

### How can I package the parts

We want to ensure the printed parts are of the highest quality and does no harm.  

Clean all parts with alcohol (70% or better)
Mark the part with the date, material type (PETG or PLA) and then 
Don't touch the part with your bear hands
	We recommend using alcohol cleaned pliers to handle parts.
	You can use gloves, however, this can be costly.
Place the part in the bag to dry.
Seal the bag once the part is dry.

These are the original designs from Prusa.  
As of now, these is the most tested, reliable design.  
If you are looking for something to print right away, these are the files for you.  
-The RC2 shield should be printed if your machine is capable.  
-The RC1 shield should by printed if your machine is too small to fit the RC2.  
-The bottom_reinforcement file should fit on any machine.  
-You should include a bottom reinforcement with every headband for a complete kit (minus the clear plastic part)
